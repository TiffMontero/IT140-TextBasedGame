# IT140-TextBasedGame

This class assigned a final project to create a text based game. the game was to travel from room to room by writing directions and collecting items. The coal was to collect all of the items before reaching the room with the "final boss". In my interpretation, you have to collect baking ingredients to bake the perfect cake and impress Gordon Ramsey. If you have not collected all of the ingredients before reaching him, you lose the game. The map is under ProjectOne.docx.
